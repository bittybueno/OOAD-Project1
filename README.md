# Zoo Project
By: Marissa Bueno, David Martin, Nimra Sharnez

A Java Project that utilizes object oriented design and technique to run a zoo. A zookeeper performs various actions on the many different types of Animals.



### Structure 
- Created a superclass `Animal` that has `Feline`, `Canine`, and `Pachyderm` subclasses. 
- `Animal` implements the interfaces for each animals unique behavior:
  - SpeakBehavior, EatBehavior, RoamBehavior
- Class `Zookeeper` facilitates all animal behaviors through commands such as rollcall(array of animals), exercise(array of animals) etc...

### Quick Start
1. Clone the repo. May encounter a "Classpath is incomplete" error. If this happens, open every file to get around this error.
2. Run main in the Zookeeper.java file
3. Watch the zoo animals perform their daily tasks commanded by the zookeeper! 


### Platform Settings
- SDK: JDK11
- Written in Java using VS Code
- IDE used: IntelliJ IDEA
